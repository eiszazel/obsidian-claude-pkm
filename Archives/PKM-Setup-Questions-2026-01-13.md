# PKM Setup Questionnaire

Fill in your answers below each question. Be as specific or brief as you like.
When done, share this with Claude to personalize your vault.

## Part 1: Identity & Mission

### 1.1 What do you do for work?

**L2 IT Support Technician** in an enterprise environment. A typical day is: triage tickets → troubleshoot → escalate to L3 when needed → document cleanly → keep stakeholders updated. You’re intentionally leveling up on **ITIL discipline + ServiceNow process hygiene**, with a long-term arc toward **Process Manager / Platform Owner** and eventually **LLM/agentic automation + tokenization/blockchain implementation**.

### 1.2 What matters most to you in life?

* **Self-sovereignty & antifragility:** being hard to trap (financially, professionally, psychologically).
* **Mastery & leverage:** turning competence into systems that compound (automation, workflows, assets).
* **Freedom from “wagey” mode:** building income engines so you can choose how you live.
* **Virtue / “white pill” mindset:** integrity, responsibility, long-term thinking, building something that lasts.
* **Health + aesthetics:** looking sharp, feeling stable, showing up confident.
* **Real relationships + network:** a strong partnership, strong friendships, and a community you respect.

### 1.3 Personal mission statement

**“Build a sovereign, antifragile life through mastery of systems—IT process, automation, and decentralized finance—so I can create freedom for myself, raise the standards of how work gets done, and leave behind tools and ideas that outlive me.”**

## Part 2: Three-Year Vision (2026–2029)

### 2.1 Career: Where do you want to be professionally in 3 years?

**Process Management / Platform Owner** (ServiceNow-ish orbit), known internally as the person who:

* turns messy work into **clean workflows**
* ships **agentic automations** that actually reduce toil
* can translate between ops, compliance, engineering, and leadership
  Target comp: **$150k–$200k+** with real ownership and reputation.

### 2.2 Health: What does optimal health look like for you?

* **Aesthetic focus:** broader shoulders/arms, better posture, “looksmaxxing” consistency
* **Skin/hair:** consistent face + body routine, dandruff managed, clean haircut cadence
* **Energy:** stable mornings, no crash cycles, diet that you can repeat without drama
* **Habits:** gym is default, not motivation-based

### 2.3 Relationships: How do you want your relationships to evolve?

* **Partner:** more aligned on lifestyle + money + long-term location strategy; “team mode.”
* **Friends/community:** smaller, higher-trust circle; more intentional hangs; fewer random drains.
* **Network:** more high-agency people around you (builders, operators, investors), both online and IRL.

### 2.4 Personal Growth: Who do you want to become?

* **c0-shaped:** automation/IT ops + product/process + finance/tokenization literacy
* **Communication:** concise, executive-friendly writing + calm authority in meetings
* **Leadership traits:** ownership, follow-through, boundary-setting, consistency
* **Technical growth:** agents/LLM tooling, workflow design, token engineering fundamentals, basic risk/statistics fluency

### 2.5 Financial: What does financial success mean to you?

* **Freedom + liquidity:** money accessible when markets are ugly.
* **Multiple income engines:** not just “price go up,” but cashflow mechanisms you control.
* **Compounding with intent:** aggressive growth, but with defensive structure.
* **Optionality:** ability to relocate, take risk, and choose projects without panic.

### 2.6 Fun/Creativity: What brings you joy outside of work?

* Building **code/systems** (dashboards, automations, bots, PWAs)
* **Crypto/DeFi tinkering** as both hobby + strategy
* **Music experiments** (AI/Suno output as “creative texture”)
* Style/aesthetics upgrades (capsule wardrobe, grooming)
* Travel experiences (especially Mexico City-style weekends)
* Fitness hobbies you can return to (rock climbing, etc.)

## Part 3: This Year (2026)

### 3.1 If 2026 could only have ONE major win, what would it be?

**Become “the automation/process guy” at work by shipping a real, visible workflow improvement** (ServiceNow + agent/LLM assist + reporting) that leadership can point to, and that sets up your next role jump.

### 3.2 Theme word for 2026

**“Compounding.”**
(Your routines, skills, systems, and income engines all stack.)

### 3.3 2–3 specific goals for 2026

1. **Credibility stack:** earn **ITIL Foundation + PSM** (or equivalent) and build a small portfolio of internal process wins.
2. **Ship one real system:** a working automation suite (ticket hygiene + follow-ups + knowledge capture + metrics dashboard).
3. **Aesthetics consistency:** follow your locked gym + skincare routines with enough consistency to visibly change your frame/shoulders and overall look by year-end.

### 3.4 What are you explicitly NOT doing this year?

* **No random project sprawl:** fewer “new shiny” starts, more shipping.
* **No doomscrolling mornings:** protect the 5:30–8:30 pipeline.
* **No impulsive portfolio chaos:** fewer random adds; tighter rules for what earns allocation.
* **No saying yes to work requests without routing them properly** (process discipline > hero mode).

## Part 4: This Month (January 2026)

### 4.1 Main focus for January

**Lock the routine + clean up the operating system:** sleep, mornings, ticket hygiene, gym consistency, and a simple weekly review loop.

### 4.2 2–3 must-do outcomes

* Implement a **weekly work cadence**: triage blocks + update blocks + escalation discipline.
* Get your **goal tracking vault** (or equivalent) running: quarter → month → week → day.
* Maintain consistency on **gym + skincare** long enough that it feels automatic.

### 4.3 Important dates / deadlines

* Any **trip/concert weekend** planning you’ve got this month (confirm exact dates).
* Work deadlines tend to be “continuous,” so your real deadlines are: **daily ticket updates + weekly closure progress**.

---

## Part 5: This Week

### 5.1 The ONE thing that makes this week successful

**Clean, consistent execution:** tickets updated daily + workouts done + no “chaos drift.”

### 5.2 Main commitments this week

* Work hours + ticket load
* Gym (morning routine)
* Any school/resume/credential work you’re keeping alive

### 5.3 Projects you’re actively working on

* **ServiceNow/ITIL leveling:** cleaner escalations, tasks vs reassignment, process literacy
* **Automation suite ideas:** Teams prompts → ticket notes; workflow capture
* **Tokenization pitch framing:** mapping use cases into step-by-step ops savings
* **Personal OS:** Obsidian goal tracking + weekly reviews
* **Portfolio engine thinking:** liquidity + income mechanisms (structured, not impulsive)

---

## Part 6: Daily Preferences

### 6.1 Ideal morning routine

You already have this basically nailed:

* 5:30 wake → bathroom → dressed (pre-laid) → no scrolling
* leave 5:45 → arrive ~7:15 → gym 7:15–8:15 → creatine/electrolytes → rinse/change → start work 8:30

### 6.2 When are you most productive?

**Morning.** You’re strongest when the day is **decision-free**, and weaker when the day becomes reactive.

### 6.3 Habits you’re building/maintaining

* Night-before prep (clothes, bags, launch pad)
* Gym consistency (looks-focused program)
* Skincare/hair consistency + dandruff management
* Daily ticket notes + weekly closure momentum
* Goal tracking + short weekly review

### 6.4 What derails your productivity?

* Phone scrolling / rabbit holes
* Too many parallel projects
* “Hero mode” at work (doing everything yourself instead of routing correctly)
* Sleep disruption / inconsistent evenings

## Part 7: Working With Claude (or me)

### 7.1 How do you prefer feedback?

**Direct, structured, practical.** No babying—just tell you what to do, what to cut, and what to measure. Encouragement is fine, but only if it’s attached to execution.

### 7.2 What should I hold you accountable for?

* **Routine consistency** (night-before + morning pipeline)
* **Shipping one real automation/process win**
* **Weekly review + goal tracking**
* **Not adding chaos** (projects, purchases, portfolio moves) without rules

### 7.3 Areas where you want ongoing help

* Turning your career arc into **a clean roadmap** (skills → projects → evidence → promotion)
* Building **agentic automation ideas** into real, shippable systems
* Keeping your **personal OS** simple (weekly plans, checklists, review prompts)
* Portfolio structure when you ask (allocation rules, tracking, risk containment)

If you want, I can also rewrite this into a tighter “one-page personal operating manual” you can keep in Obsidian and review weekly.
