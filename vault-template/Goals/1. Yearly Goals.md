## ONE METRIC THAT MATTERS

**Ship one visible automation/process win** that leadership can point to—the thing that establishes you as "the automation/process guy."

Current Status: `[0/1 shipped]` - Updated: 2026-01-13

## NOT Doing This Year

1. **No random project sprawl:** fewer "new shiny" starts, more shipping
2. **No doomscrolling mornings:** protect the 5:30–8:30 pipeline
3. **No impulsive portfolio chaos:** tighter rules for what earns allocation
4. **No hero mode at work:** process discipline > doing everything yourself

## Year-End Vision
*December 31st, 2026*

It's the end of 2026 and I'm the person leadership points to when they talk about process improvement and automation. I shipped a real system this year—not just an idea, but something running in production that saves people time. ITIL and PSM are done. My mornings run on autopilot: gym at 7:15, work by 8:30, no drama. The weekly review habit has stuck, and I can see my goals compounding. My frame looks noticeably different. I'm positioned for the role jump in 2027.
