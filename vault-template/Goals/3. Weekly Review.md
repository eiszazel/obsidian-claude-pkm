## Work Focus

### Ticket Discipline
- **Triage blocks:** Morning first thing
- **Update blocks:** Before leaving each day
- **Escalation rule:** If stuck >24 hours, route or escalate—don't hero it

### Process Wins This Week
- (Log any clean escalations, closures, or process improvements)

---

## Potential Obstacles

1. **Obstacle:** Phone/scrolling derailing mornings
   - **Strategy:** Phone stays in another room until after gym

2. **Obstacle:** Getting pulled into hero mode at work
   - **Strategy:** Route correctly, update notes, don't absorb everything

3. **Obstacle:** Skipping night prep because tired
   - **Strategy:** 5-minute rule—just lay out clothes, bags, basics
